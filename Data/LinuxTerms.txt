Windowing system:  software that manages separately different parts of display screens, type of GUI that implements WIMP
	X-windows system (X): Windowing system, basic framework for GUI environment, newest core protocol version is x11
		Display server: Control input and output of clients (running software) to the OS and hardware, the display server protocol can operate over networks 
		XFree86: Outdated display server for X
		X.Org: Display server for X
		window manager: controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface

networking
	ttl (time-to-live)
		many uses
			packets
				initial value set by server that reduces by one everytime a packet passes through a network device, if it hits zero the packet is discarded, stop packets endless looping
			dns servers
				it determines the lifetime of dns records, this speeds up connections because the dns server knows how long to cache the IP address	

Python interpretor
	all functions, lists, objects are python code objects
	bytecode is an attribute of the code object (foo.func_code.co_code)
	this is a series of bytes that translates into numbers, translate with the dis module
	import dis
	dis.dis(foo.func_code)
	offset in the bytecode (index position)-> byte names (for human benefit) -> argument (repersented as an index into other attributes of the code object) -> actual argument fetched by dis
	byte names stored as keys in a dictionary with the byte values as values
		def_op('LOAD_CONST', 100)       # Index in const list
		def_op('BUILD_TUPLE', 102)      # Number of tuple items
		def_op('BUILD_LIST', 103)       # Number of list items
		def_op('BUILD_SET', 104)        # Number of set items
	python compiler generates bytecode -> python interpretor -> make sense of bytecode via the virtual machine
