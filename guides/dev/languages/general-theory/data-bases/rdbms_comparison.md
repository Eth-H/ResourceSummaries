# sql constraints
    UNIQUE: Applying this constraint to a column ensures that no two entries in that column are identical 
    NOT NULL: This constraint ensures that a column doesnâ€™t have any NULL entries 
    PRIMARY KEY: A combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL, the PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that no entry in the column is NULL and that every entry is distinct 
    FOREIGN KEY: A FOREIGN KEY is a column in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY of another table  This constraint is used to link two tables together: entries to the FOREIGN KEY column must already exist in the parent PRIMARY KEY column for the write process to succeed 
    CHECK: This constraint limits the range of values that can be entered into a column  For example, if your application is intended only for residents of Alaska, you could add a CHECK constraint on a ZIP code column to only allow entries between 99501 and 99950 
    DEFAULT: This provides a default value for a given column  Unless another value is specified, SQLite enters the default value automatically 
    INDEX: Used to help retrieve data from a table more quickly, this constraint is similar to an index in a textbook: instead of having to review every entry in a table, a query only has to review entries from the indexed column to find the desired results 

# SQLite
serverless
## eval
    adv
        small footprint / lightweight: no external dependancies, <600Kb
        user-friendly: no config, no server (easy to integrate)
        portable: stored as one file (not across large batch of files)
    disadv (all non-server related)
        Limited concurrency: multiple concurrent process access/queries, but only one change at once, < server dbs
        no user management: access privallges limited to OS (dont fit different permission lvs)
        security: client bugs dont effect a server, easier to control data access to one persistent server process
        
    fits: embedded apps (portabliliy, no future expansions), disk access, testing
    dont fit: lots of data (<140TB but difficult to manage), high write volumes, network access to db (separate machines)

## data types
    null: NULL values
    integer: Signed ints, stored in one of 1-4,6,8 bytes relative to magnitude
    real: Real nums / floating point, stored as 8-byte
    text: Text strings, stored using the db encoding (UTF-8/UTF-16BE/UTF-16LE)
    blob: Any blob of data, each blob stored as inp

# MySQL
server daemon process
phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, HeidiSQL

## eval
    adv
        popular (docs, help) and easy to use, security (user management, security setup script), speed, replication(share info across hosts, fit backup and horizontall scaling)
    disadv
        limitations (lack sql compilance/features), licensing (has paid edition), slow dev
    fits: distributed sys, web apps, expected future db growth
    dont fit: good sql compilance, concurrency (read-writes bad)
