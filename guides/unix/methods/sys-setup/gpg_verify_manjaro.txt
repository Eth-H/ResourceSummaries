.ISO and .ISO.SIG files
sudo pacman -S gnupg wget

//Download all keys from the Manjaro Developers from GitHub or get philips key
wget github.com/manjaro/packages-core/raw/master/manjaro-keyring/manjaro.gpg
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --search-keys 11C7F07E
//import all the keys in the downloaded .GPG file into your gnupg keyring
gpg --import manjaro.gpg

gpg --verify manjaro-xfce-16.06-pre2-x86_64.iso.sig
Compare the key, which was used to sign the .ISO file to the key

Check, whether the .ISO was verified by Philip MÃ¼ller's key ("11C7F07E") or another Manjaro Developer's key, which you have imported to your system
