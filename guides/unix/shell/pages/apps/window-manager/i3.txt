A split container can have one of the following layouts:
	splith/splitv
		Windows are sized so that every window gets an equal amount of space in the container. splith distributes the windows horizontally (windows are right next to each other), splitv distributes them vertically (windows are on top of each other).
	stacking
		Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of windows at the top of the container.
	tabbed
		The same principle as stacking, but the list of windows at the top is only a single line which is vertically split.
