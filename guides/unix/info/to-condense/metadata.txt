inodes (index node)
    all inodes stored at start of partition in a table
    store file metadata (so dont store name or data)
    every file has an entry, including file name and inode num 
    if all inodes used up cant create any more files

    for hard links, the files share an inode
    for some filesystems, can include inline data in inodes for tiny files (60ish bytes)

//inodes for current dir
ls -i

//entire disk inodes
df -hi
