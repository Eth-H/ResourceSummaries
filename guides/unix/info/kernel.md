# linux os abstraction lvs
    hardware: cpu, mem, disk, network ports, ...
    physical layer: machine computation (0s and 1s)
    kernel layer: talk to hardware
        process and memory management, device communication, system calls, sets up our filesystem
    user space: shell, programs, graphics, ...

# privilege levels 
    kernel mode
        hardware, network
    user mode
        small amount mem space and cpu access
    lvs correspond to protection rings
        different rings of privilege control
        Ring #0: kernel, ring#3: user mode apps

# sys calls
    provide user space kernel a way to ask for kernel to do something
    sys calls api has a fixed num services with a unique id

    programs (EG ls) sys call wrapper invokes sys call -> exes a trap -> caught by sys call handler -> ref sys call in sys call table -> exe func -> return to user mode with return status

    view sys calls made by cmd
        strace ls

# manage installation
    can have multiple kernels for grub to boot
    install general/recommended or specific version, then any other pkgs such as linux-headers, linux-image-generic

    get activate kernel
        uname -r
    update all pkgs (including kernel)
        sudo apt dist-upgrade

# kernel location
    /boot/
        vmlinux 
            kernel
            statically linked exe  in an obj file format
            vmlinuz
                bzImage
                compressed with LZMA, bzip2 or gzip
        initrd //tmp fs used before loading kernel
        System.map //symbolic lookup table
        config //kernel config, need to compile to edit loaded modules
    can get rid of  unused kernels
        but keep an older backup

# kernel modules
    code that can be on demand loaded into kernel (even when booted generally)
    
    //currently loaded
        lsmod
    //load/unload modules with full path
        insmod /lib/modules/4.4.0-21-generic/kernel/drivers/cpufreq/speedstep-lib.ko
        rmmod /lib/modules/4.4.0-21-generic/kernel/drivers/cpufreq/speedstep-lib.ko
    //load/unload modules (and dependancies) from /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers 
        sudo modprobe bluetooth
        sudo modprobe -r bluetooth
    //add config file to load/stop loading modules during boot
        /etc/modprobe.d/peanutbutter.conf
            options peanut_butter type=almond 
            blacklist peanut_butter

# kernel params
    most params coinside with files in /proc/sys subdirectories
        EG
            net.ipv4.ip_forward â†’ /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    list all modifiable
        sysctl -a  
    list/change specific param
        sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
        cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        //non-persistent change
            echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
            sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
        //persistent changes
            //edit variables in /etc/sysctl.d
        //apply changes to current runtime config (from non-persistent or persistent mtds)
            sysctl -p
    EG important params
        fs.file-max //max num file handles kernel can allocate, allows more open files
        kernel.sysrq //enable SysRq key (print screen)
        net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all //ignore and drop ping reqs at kernel lv
